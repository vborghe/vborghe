Hi! I am a cognitive and clinical neuroscientist. As of September 2022 I work as an Assistant Professor at the University of Geneva ([UNIGE/FPSE](https://www.unige.ch/fapse/)) within the Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) “[Evolving Language](https://evolvinglanguage.ch/)”. 

I lead the Neurobiology of Concepts Expression Laboratory ([NoCE Lab](https://evolvinglanguage.ch/)), which focuses on studying the cognitive and neural correlates of semantic knowledge and their interplay with language, using both behavioural and neuroimaging techniques. 

I obtained her PhD in cognitive neuroscience from the Sorbonne University in Paris and conducted my postdoctoral research in clinical and computational neuroscience respectively at the University of California San Francisco and Université de Montreal. 

I am passionate about (and active in) making clinical and cognitive neuroscience [ethically conscious](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.25351), [community-driven](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0896627321002312), [diverse](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.117742) & [inclusive](https://www.winrepo.org/about/), and [environmentally friendly](https://osf.io/6zysw/). I also care about bridging neuroscience and the [arts](https://apertureneuropub.cloud68.co/articles/55/), as well as [science dissemination]([https://www.winrepo.org/about/](https://sites.google.com/view/penne-amiche-della-scienza/chi-siamo?authuser=0))
